            <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
            <p>Hi! My name is Dawit Kasy, and I am a Junior at Quinnipiac University studying Computer Science.</p>

            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>I completed my high school education at Mountain Mission School in 2023, 
            and I am currently enrolled at Quinnipiac University, where I anticipate graduating in 2027.</p>

            <h2>Why did I choose Computer Science?</h2>
            <p>With how involved technology is in everyday life, I was always curious to learn how it worked.
            I wanted to learn how computers turn 1's and 0's into the incredible applications we all use today, 
            and apply what I learn to build something I would want to use.</p>

            <h2>Experience</h2>
            <p>I currently have about three school year's worth of experience learning in the Java programming language. 
            I have experience with Object Oriented Programming principles and data structures and algorithms, Agile Development, Object Oriented Programming, Data Structures, Algorithms, Git, GitHub, Visual Studio Code, GitHub, Trello, Unity, R</p>
